# What's Blockchain?


> Blockchain is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography.
> Each block typically contains a hash pointer as a link to a previous block, a timestamp and transaction data. 
> By design, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data. 
> A blockchain can serve as "an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently
> and in a verifiable and permanent way."
>

> Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger for recording the history of transactions. 
> It fosters a new generation of transactional applications that establish trust, accountability and transparency - from contracts to deeds to payments.
