### Move

_The Contract-Oriented Programming Language for Digital (Blockchain) Resources / Assets_

- [The Official Move: A Language With Programmable Resources White Paper - Web Version](https://developers.libra.org/docs/move-paper), [PDF Download (~200k, 26 Pages)](move-whitepaper.pdf) 

> Abstract: We present Move, a safe and flexible programming language for the Libra Blockchain [1][2].
> Move is an executable bytecode language used to implement custom transactions and smart contracts.
> The key feature of Move is the ability to define custom resource types with semantics inspired by linear
> logic [3]: a resource can never be copied or implicitly discarded, only moved between program storage
> locations. These safety guarantees are enforced statically by Move’s type system. Despite these
> special protections, resources are ordinary program values — they can be stored in data structures,
> passed as arguments to procedures, and so on. First-class resources are a very general concept that
> programmers can use not only to implement safe digital assets but also to write correct business
> logic for wrapping assets and enforcing access control policies. The safety and expressivity of Move
> have enabled us to implement significant parts of the Libra protocol in Move, including Libra coin,
> transaction processing, and validator management.
