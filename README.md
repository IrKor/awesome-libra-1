# Awesome Libra (and Move)

_Moving money around the world should be as easy and cheap as sending a text message (or a photo)._

### Blockchain

- [The Official Libra Blockchain White Paper - Web Version](https://developers.libra.org/docs/the-libra-blockchain-paper), [PDF Download (~400k, 29 Pages)](libra-blockchain-whitepaper.pdf) 

> **Abstract**: The Libra Blockchain is a decentralized, programmable database designed to support a
> low-volatility cryptocurrency that will have the ability to serve as an efficient medium of exchange for
> billions of people around the world. We present a proposal for the Libra protocol, which implements
> the Libra Blockchain and aims to create a financial infrastructure that can foster innovation, lower
> barriers to entry, and improve access to financial services. To validate the design of the Libra protocol,
> we have built an open-source prototype implementation — Libra Core — in anticipation of a global
> collaborative effort to advance this new ecosystem.
>
> The Libra protocol allows a set of replicas - referred to as validators - from different authorities
> to jointly maintain a database of programmable resources. These resources are owned by different
> user accounts authenticated by public key cryptography and adhere to custom rules specified by the
> developers of these resources. Validators process transactions and interact with each other to reach
> consensus on the state of the database. Transactions are based on predefined and, in future versions,
> user-defined smart contracts in a new programming language called Move.
>
> We use Move to define the core mechanisms of the blockchain, such as the currency and validator
> membership. These core mechanisms enable the creation of a unique governance mechanism that
> builds on the stability and reputation of existing institutions in the early days but transitions to a
> fully open system over time.

### Move

_The Contract-Oriented Programming Language for Digital (Blockchain) Resources / Assets_

- [The Official Move: A Language With Programmable Resources White Paper - Web Version](https://developers.libra.org/docs/move-paper), [PDF Download (~200k, 26 Pages)](move-whitepaper.pdf) 

> **Abstract:** We present Move, a safe and flexible programming language for the Libra Blockchain [1][2].
> Move is an executable bytecode language used to implement custom transactions and smart contracts.
> The key feature of Move is the ability to define custom resource types with semantics inspired by linear
> logic [3]: a resource can never be copied or implicitly discarded, only moved between program storage
> locations. These safety guarantees are enforced statically by Move’s type system. Despite these
> special protections, resources are ordinary program values — they can be stored in data structures,
> passed as arguments to procedures, and so on. First-class resources are a very general concept that
> programmers can use not only to implement safe digital assets but also to write correct business
> logic for wrapping assets and enforcing access control policies. The safety and expressivity of Move
> have enabled us to implement significant parts of the Libra protocol in Move, including Libra coin,
> transaction processing, and validator management.
