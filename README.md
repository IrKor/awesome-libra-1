# What's Blockchain?


> Blockchain is a distributed database with a list (that is, chain) of records (that is, blocks) 
> linked and secured by digital fingerprints (that is, cryptho hashes).

> Blockchain is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography.
> Each block typically contains a hash pointer as a link to a previous block, a timestamp and transaction data. 
> By design, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data. 
> A blockchain can serve as "an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently
> and in a verifiable and permanent way."

> Blockchain is a public database where new data are stored in a container called a block 
> and are added to an immutable chain (hence blockchain) with data added in the past.
> In the case of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, these data are groups of transactions. 
> But, the data can be of any type, of course.

> Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger for recording the history of transactions. 
> It fosters a new generation of transactional applications that establish trust, accountability and transparency - from contracts to deeds to payments.

> Blockchain is an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record 
> not just financial transactions but virtually everything of value.
